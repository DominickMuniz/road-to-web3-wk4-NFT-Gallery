# road-to-web3-wk4-NFT-Gallery
Following along Alchemy's Road2Web3 challenge. This is the project for wk4. 


This app is a front end that allows users to search all NFTs within a collection (by contract addy), or by Wallet address to see all nfts owned by an individual. You can also search/filter to see if a wallet has items from a particular collection.

it was styled using tailwind CSS, and created using 'npx create-next-app -e with tailwindcss'

99% of this code is stolen -- however I did infact type everything. lol
